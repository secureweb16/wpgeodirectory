Events Calendar for GeoDirectory add-on allows to extend your GeoDirectory powered website with a versatile event manager.

== Description ==

The Events Calendar for GeoDirectory add-on is a compelling way to feature events in your directory, using Custom Post Types (CPT). The add-on creates the CPT Events, by adding time and date to a standard listing. Users can now choose to list a place or an event.

= Recurring Events Included =

Do you host the same event every week or every month? You can set events as recurring daily, weekly, monthly, annual events and even pick custom dates, to save entering a separate one-off listing each time.

It's easy to sort events by selecting "upcoming," "today," "past" or "all" and display custom events lists, grids and a simple events calendar anywhere using widgets. By default, events are ordered with the upcoming event first.

= Events Locator =

Events can be easily displayed on a map, allowing user to locate your events with ease. Easily show distance from them and directions.
